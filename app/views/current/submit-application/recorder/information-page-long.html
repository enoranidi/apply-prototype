						<p class="govuk-body">There are three jurisdictions in the Social Entitlement Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal. These are:</p>
						<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
							<li>Social Security and Child Support.</li>
							<li>Asylum Support.</li>
							<li>Criminal Injuries Compensation.</li>
						</ol>
						<p class="govuk-body">Your work will be in the Social Security and Child Support jurisdiction. You will sit on appeals that involve Disability Living Allowance, Personal Independence Payments and Attendance Allowance.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">You will sit on the tribunal alongside a Medical Member and a Judge to decide cases brought before the tribunal. You will be given the papers for the hearing in advance. You will be expected to read and understand the information before the hearing starts. This may involve studying substantial amounts of complex documentary evidence.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">During the hearing, you will use your experience of disabilities to assist the tribunal. You will do this by:</p>
						<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
							<li>applying your knowledge to the facts of the case</li>
							<li>examining the evidence</li>
							<li>asking questions during the hearing</li>
							<li>helping to reach a decision on the appeal with the other panel members</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="govuk-body">You will be assigned to a primary tribunal venue based on your home location and will be asked to undertake tribunal business as the need arises.  Tribunal hearings are normally held on weekdays and you would normally be given about a month's notice of hearings. How often you are asked to sit will depend on the workload of the tribunal as well as your own commitments and availability.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">Subject to the availability of work, you will usually be expected to sit at least 15 days a year for tribunal business, and to attend mandatory training. A sitting day comprises 2 sessions (morning and afternoon) and you will usually be required to sit for both the morning and afternoon session.  The usual requirement is to sit for a day at a time (non-consecutive). You will need to attend the Tribunal in person.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">If required, reasonable adjustments, including the presence of a carer, can be made for members with disabilities. This might include only sitting for 1 session (half a day) at a time.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">If you are successful in the recruitment process and are in receipt of benefits please contact the DWP to report a <a href="#" class="govuk-link">change in circumstance</a>. If you start or change work it may affect your benefits. Please use an independent benefits calculator to find out if your benefits will change <a href="#" class="govuk-link">here</a>.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">Fee: £210.14</p>
						<p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Location and jurisdiction</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">Vacancies are available across England and Wales.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">You will be assigned to a judicial region and allocated a primary hearing venue, normally one closest to your home.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">The judicial regions are:</p>
						<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
							<li>London</li>
							<li>Midlands</li>
							<li>North East</li>
							<li>North West</li>
							<li>South East</li>
							<li>South West</li>
							<li>Wales</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="govuk-body">You will be asked to indicate which locations, if successful, you would prefer to be deployed to. You will also be asked to indicate which other locations, that are not your preference, where you would nevertheless accept an offer of appointment.</p>

						<p class="govuk-body">To be considered for appointment, you must meet the eligibility requirements for this post. It is your responsibility and in your own interest, to ensure that you meet the eligibility requirements before submitting an application. Eligibility will be assessed prior to selection days.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Statutory eligibility criteria</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">A person is eligible for appointment if they are a person, other than a registered medical practitioner, who is experienced in dealing with the physical or mental needs of disabled persons because they –</p>
						<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
							<li>work with disabled persons in a professional or voluntary capacity; or</li>
							<li>are themselves disabled.</li>
						</ol>
						<p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Explanation of statutory eligibility</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">A person is eligible for appointment if he/she is a person, other than a registered medical practitioner, who is experienced in dealing with the physical or mental needs of disabled persons because they work with disabled persons in a professional or voluntary capacity, or are themselves disabled.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">Work with disabled people includes those trained as physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, community psychiatric nurses, nurses and social workers working with disabled people but not just the elderly.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">Voluntary work means that you must actually deal with the physical or mental needs of a disabled person on a regular basis.  For example, you may work in a voluntary capacity in a rehabilitation centre every week or you may be the registered or full-time carer for a disabled person who you assist and tend frequently.   It does not mean someone who visits a disabled person on a less frequent basis, for example every two weeks or so.  The interaction between you and the disabled person or people must be frequent and in a supportive capacity.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">Experience does not include someone who advises on welfare benefits.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">Disability is wider than just having a physical or mental impairment. An individual would normally qualify for Disability Living Allowance/Personal Independence Payments or Attendance Allowance (though one may choose not to claim these benefits).  This includes those who have lost limbs or have conditions that preclude them from walking such as polio or severe arthritis, those with sight or hearing impairment and those with a debilitating disease, such as Crohn’s disease for instance.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Reasonable length of service</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">There is no upper or lower age limit for candidates apart from the statutory retirement age of 70. However, the age at which someone is appointed should allow for a reasonable length of service. For this position it is usually <strong>5</strong> years before retirement.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">The JAC will decide whether a candidate will be able to provide a reasonable length of service.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">Candidates who already hold judicial appointment and were first appointed before March 1995, may have a preserved retirement age of 72. This includes candidates first appointed to a judicial office listed in Schedule 7 to the Judicial Pensions and Retirement Act 1993. Such candidates should inform the JAC about their retirement age.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Citizenship</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">At the time of application, candidates must be either a:</p>
						<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
							<li>UK citizen</li>
							<li>citizen of another Commonwealth country</li>
							<li>citizen of the Republic of Ireland</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="govuk-body">Other European Union citizens are not eligible to apply.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Disqualification</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">You should note that the <a href="#" class="govuk-link">House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975</a> applies to this office. For further details please refer to the <a href="#" class="govuk-link">terms and conditions</a>.</p>

						<p class="govuk-body">There are <strong>5</strong> competencies in total that list the behaviours expected of a fee-paid disability qualified member who is performing the role effectively. You should read the <a href="#" class="govuk-link">competency framework</a> for the role and the <a href="#" class="govuk-link">job description</a> before completing your application.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">Candidates are not asked to provide competency examples at the application stage, these will be tested at selection day. Candidates will be required to complete an online application containing basic details, including their personal profile, character profile, an eligibility statement and contact details of <strong>2</strong> independent assessors.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">If you would like a copy of the application form in Welsh, please contact the Selection Exercise team via <a href="#" class="govuk-link">DQTM2020@judicialappointments.gov.uk</a></p>

						<p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Eligibility statement</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">In your application, you are required to complete an eligibility statement to demonstrate, in no more than 250 words, how you satisfy the statutory requirements for this post.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">Please include either, if you have lived experience of a disability:</p>

							<li>Please explain your experience?</li>
							<li>Please give examples of how your experiences of disability as a carer, volunteer or professional can contribute to the position of lay disability member?</li>
						</ul>

						<p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Shortlisting</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">The number of applications we receive will determine the means by which shortlisting decisions are taken. If the number of applications far exceeds the number of vacancies, an online qualifying test will be used to determine which candidates are invited to a selection day. If required, a qualifying test will take place between <strong>7am and 9pm on 30 April 2020</strong>. If fewer applications are received and an online qualifying test is not deemed necessary, shortlisting will be against the eligibility criteria only, taking account of the information provided in your eligibility statement.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">The structure of the test will also depend on the number of applications received:</p>
						<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
							<li>Part 1: 45-minute multiple choice Situational Judgement test</li>
							<li>If required – Part 2: 45-minute multiple choice Critical Analysis test</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="govuk-body">All applicants will receive an email advising whether the qualifying test will be taking place and confirming the structure of the test(s) by <strong>Friday 3 April 2020</strong>. If you have not received this email by close of business on <strong>3 April 2020</strong> please contact the JAC at <a href="#" class="govuk-link">DQTM2020@judicialappointments.gov.uk</a>. If the two-part test will be taking place, your email will include material required for the Critical Analysis test. It is recommended that you familiarise yourself with this material prior to taking the test.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">If you are unable to sit the test on the date specified above due to exceptional circumstances please email <a href="#" class="govuk-link">DQTM2020@judicialappointments.gov.uk</a> as soon as you apply.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">All candidates should make the necessary arrangements to sit the test in a suitable and quiet environment ensuring consistent and reliable access to a stable internet connection.  It is recommended that you take a break between the two parts of the test (if both parts are required).</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">All applicants will receive qualifying test instructions by email on <strong>23 April 2020</strong>. If you have not received this email by close of business on <strong>23 April 2020</strong> please contact the JAC immediately.</p>
