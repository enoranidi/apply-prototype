						<p class="govuk-body">There are three jurisdictions in the Social Entitlement Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal. These are:</p>
						<ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
							<li>Social Security and Child Support.</li>
							<li>Asylum Support.</li>
							<li>Criminal Injuries Compensation.</li>
						</ol>
						<p class="govuk-body">Your work will be in the Social Security and Child Support jurisdiction. You will sit on appeals that involve Disability Living Allowance, Personal Independence Payments and Attendance Allowance.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">You will sit on the tribunal alongside a Medical Member and a Judge to decide cases brought before the tribunal. You will be given the papers for the hearing in advance. You will be expected to read and understand the information before the hearing starts. This may involve studying substantial amounts of complex documentary evidence.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">During the hearing, you will use your experience of disabilities to assist the tribunal. You will do this by:</p>
						<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
							<li>applying your knowledge to the facts of the case</li>
							<li>examining the evidence</li>
							<li>asking questions during the hearing</li>
							<li>helping to reach a decision on the appeal with the other panel members</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="govuk-body">You will be assigned to a primary tribunal venue based on your home location and will be asked to undertake tribunal business as the need arises.  Tribunal hearings are normally held on weekdays and you would normally be given about a month's notice of hearings. How often you are asked to sit will depend on the workload of the tribunal as well as your own commitments and availability.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">Subject to the availability of work, you will usually be expected to sit at least 15 days a year for tribunal business, and to attend mandatory training. A sitting day comprises 2 sessions (morning and afternoon) and you will usually be required to sit for both the morning and afternoon session.  The usual requirement is to sit for a day at a time (non-consecutive). You will need to attend the Tribunal in person.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">If required, reasonable adjustments, including the presence of a carer, can be made for members with disabilities. This might include only sitting for 1 session (half a day) at a time.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">If you are successful in the recruitment process and are in receipt of benefits please contact the DWP to report a <a href="#" class="govuk-link">change in circumstance</a>. If you start or change work it may affect your benefits. Please use an independent benefits calculator to find out if your benefits will change <a href="#" class="govuk-link">here</a>.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">Fee: Â£210.14</p>
						<p class="govuk-body govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Location and jurisdiction</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">Vacancies are available across England and Wales.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">You will be assigned to a judicial region and allocated a primary hearing venue, normally one closest to your home.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">The judicial regions are:</p>
						<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
							<li>London</li>
							<li>Midlands</li>
							<li>North East</li>
							<li>North West</li>
							<li>South East</li>
							<li>South West</li>
							<li>Wales</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="govuk-body">You will be asked to indicate which locations, if successful, you would prefer to be deployed to. You will also be asked to indicate which other locations, that are not your preference, where you would nevertheless accept an offer of appointment.</p>
						<p class="govuk-body">Advice on selecting <a href="#" class="govuk-link">locations and jurisdictions</a> is available.</p>
